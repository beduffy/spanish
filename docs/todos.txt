use y2doc or my own thing to easily convert videos or blogs i care about to text. 

maybe youtube integration isnt even needed. Would be convenient? 
How many youtube videos have auto dubbing? Could I show live transcription of german of german (or english translation to german) and then click on the words like reimplementing lingopie but ANY VIDEO? how difficult? 

Store numbers of words from blogs? or? 

think more. 

too many afk sessions

create many stats and charts. 


dont understand and see tokens, dictionary and many other features. 

listen amount and read amount wrong, and progress wrong. 
mark lesson as completed.

Cheapest LLM APIs (good enough quality for Anki)

Prices are per 1M tokens (input vs output). For Anki, output pricing matters a lot because explanations are output-heavy.

Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (very cheap, good for short explanations)
$0.10 in / $0.40 out (standard). 
Google AI for Developers

DeepSeek (deepseek-chat, V3.2) (extremely cheap; quality often surprisingly strong)
$0.28 in (cache miss) / $0.42 out 
api-docs.deepseek.com

OpenAI GPT-4o mini (reliable instruction-following; great for “be concise”)
$0.15 in / $0.60 out 
OpenAI Platform

Anthropic Claude Haiku (usually very nice writing style; costs more)
Example: Claude Haiku 3: $0.25 in / $1.25 out 
platform.claude.com

Groq hosted Llama (fast, cheap-ish, great latency)
Example shown: Llama 3.3 70B: $0.59 in / $0.79 out 
Groq
+1

What “cheap” looks like per Anki card

If one card uses ~300 input + 300 output tokens:

Gemini Flash-Lite: about $0.00015 
Google AI for Developers

DeepSeek-chat: about $0.00021 
api-docs.deepseek.com

GPT-4o mini: about $0.000225 
OpenAI Platform

What to prioritize (big payoff)

lemmatization (sehen/sah/gesehen unify)

store surface form + lemma + sentence

fast “save” while reading

“known/unknown” highlighting

What to delay

perfect grammar explanations

perfect audio generation

huge analytics dashboard

importing 10 different formats



6) What I’d prioritize next (concrete)

Given your list, here’s the “highest leverage next 10”:

Suspend/mastered on card + “known words highlighting”

Review page shows only Due today + optional “Study ahead”

Card details: interval, ease, next due (simple and transparent)

One-tap “Add card” with no alerts, just subtle toast

Fix popover positioning + close UX

Add tags: source + topic + grammar

Batch add from a lesson (select 10 words → add)

Lemmatization storage (even if heuristic first)

Export: CSV (cards + scheduling fields) + a DB dump script

Basic stats: minutes read, cards added, reviews done

Everything else goes into a backlog.
