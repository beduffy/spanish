If you mean “LingoPie-style language-learning player, but it works on **any** video you point it at,” the difficulty depends massively on *where the video comes from* and whether you want **subtitles only** or **full auto-dubbing**.

LingoPie’s “core loop” is basically: **dual subtitles + clickable words (dictionary/translation) + save vocab/flashcards + interactive transcript**. ([Lingopie][1])

## Part 1: “German video first” (dual subs + click-to-translate)

### Easiest path (your own MP4 + you already have German + English subtitle files)

**Difficulty: medium (roughly 3–5/10).**
You can build an MVP with:

* A web video player (Shaka Player / Video.js)
* Load 2 subtitle tracks (German + English) (SRT → WebVTT)
* Render subtitles yourself (so you can make each word clickable)
* On click: show translation + lemma + pronunciation + “save to vocab list”

**Main gotcha:** subtitle files are timed by *line*, not by *word*. Clicking a word is easy, but highlighting the *exact spoken word timing* (karaoke-style) needs extra work.

### Next level (auto-generate subtitles if none exist)

**Difficulty: higher (6–7/10).**
Pipeline:

1. Extract audio
2. ASR (speech-to-text) in German (e.g., Whisper-class models)
3. Produce German subtitles with timestamps
4. Machine-translate to English
5. Optional: “forced alignment” to get cleaner word-level timing (for smooth word highlighting / click-to-seek)

This is where quality issues start: names, slang, overlapping speech, background music, etc.

## “ANY VIDEO” is the real fork in the road

### Case A — Local files / user uploads you control

This is the most realistic “any video.” You can process the file server-side (or locally) and your player can do everything.

### Case B — “Any streaming site” (Netflix/Disney/etc.)

This becomes **much harder** (often impractical) because of DRM, changing web players, legal/ToS constraints, and difficulty intercepting clean video/subtitle data reliably. This is why “any video on the internet” is not the same as “any video file.”

## Part 2: “Later auto-dubbed German → English video”

This is a *different product tier*. **Subtitles are one thing; dubbing is another.**

To auto-dub well you typically need:

1. **Diarization** (who spoke when)
2. **ASR** (German transcript with good timing)
3. **Translation** (German → English, preserving intent/tone)
4. **TTS** (generate English speech)
5. **Voice strategy**

   * generic narrator voices (easier), or
   * voice cloning / per-speaker voices (harder + safety/policy constraints)
6. **Audio mixing**

   * ducking background audio
   * handling music, laughter, cross-talk
7. **Timing / lip-sync**

   * optional but users expect it if you call it “dubbed”

**Difficulty: very high (8–9/10)** if you want it to feel like a real dub (natural prosody, consistent voices, good timing, not stepping on the soundtrack).

## Practical “how hard” summary

* **Dual subtitles for your own German videos (with subtitle files):** 3/10
* **Add clickable word lookup + saved vocab/flashcards:** 5/10 ([Lingopie][1])
* **Truly “any video” by generating subtitles + translation automatically:** 7/10
* **High-quality auto-dubbing German → English at scale:** 9/10

## What I’d build first (minimal but legit)

If your goal is “LingoPie but for arbitrary German videos,” the best MVP is:

* Accept MP4 (or YouTube *you own / permitted*)
* Generate German subtitles (ASR)
* Generate English subtitles (MT)
* Dual subtitle UI + click word → translation + save vocab
* Vocab review page (simple SRS later)

Then only after that works well:

* Add dubbing as an optional “audio track,” starting with **single English narrator voice** (much easier than per-speaker voice matching)

## One non-technical blocker: rights

If you plan to support *copyrighted* videos users don’t own and you’re processing/redistributing them, that can become the hardest part (licensing + compliance). If it’s strictly “bring your own video” and processing is private, the path is cleaner.

If you tell me what “ANY VIDEO” means for you (local files vs YouTube vs Netflix/etc.), I can map the exact architecture and the main engineering risks for that specific route.
